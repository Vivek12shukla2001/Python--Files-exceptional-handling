What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","    Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime (e.g., Python).\n","    Compiled languages translate code into machine code before execution.\n","\n","    Interpreted languages provide flexibility and easier debugging, while compiled languages offer faster execution.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","    Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, finally, and else blocks to prevent program crashes.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","    The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, ensuring resource cleanup like closing files or releasing memory.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","    Logging is a way to record program events, warnings, and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes using the logging module.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","    The __del__ method is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope, helping in cleanup.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","    import module imports the entire module, requiring you to use module.function().\n","    from module import function imports specific functions or classes directly, allowing function() to be used without the module name.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","    Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks or a single block with tuple syntax:\n","\n"," try:\n","     Some code\n","except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","    The with statement automatically closes the file after execution, preventing memory leaks.\n","\n","eg.\n","\n","    with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n","    data = file.read()\n","\n","\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","    Multithreading: Uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory (better for I/O-bound tasks).\n","\n","    Multiprocessing: Creates multiple independent processes, each with its own memory (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","    Helps in debugging, monitoring performance, tracking errors, and maintaining logs for future reference.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","    Python uses automatic memory management with garbage collection and reference counting to allocate and free memory dynamically.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","    try: Run the code that might cause an error.\n","    except: Handle the exception if an error occurs.\n","    else: Execute if no exception occurs.\n","    finally: Execute code regardless of whether an error occurs.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","    It prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient resource usage.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","    The try block runs code that may raise an exception.\n","    The except block catches and handles the exception to prevent the program from crashing.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","    Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector (gc module) to automatically free unused memory.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","    The else block runs code only if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","    DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, used to categorize log messages.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","    os.fork(): Creates a child process but is only available on UNIX-based systems.\n","\n","    multiprocessing: Cross-platform and provides better process management.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","    Prevents data corruption, memory leaks, and file locks by ensuring resources are properly released.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","    file.read(): Reads the entire file or a specific number of bytes.\n","    file.readline(): Reads a single line from the file.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","    The logging module is used to record events, errors, and debugging information in applications.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","    The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as creating, deleting, and renaming files and directories.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","    Circular references, high memory consumption, and the need for manual tuning using the gc module.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","    use the raise keyword:\n","\n","    raise ValueError(\"This is an error message\")\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","    It improves performance in I/O-bound tasks like web scraping, file handling, and GUI applications by running multiple threads simultaneously.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7ELxn3Hd2sIb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"jUxGJsgm6gD1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Vraj0m0J7Fae"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import logging\n","import os\n","\n","# 1.
